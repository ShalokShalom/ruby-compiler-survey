title: The Ruby Compiler Survey
layout: page
---

The *Ruby Compiler Survey* is a project cataloging, preserving, and dissecting compilers for the [Ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). In this context, a compiler is something that eventually produces machine code from Ruby code, whether that's ahead-of-time or just-in-time. There are a surprisingly large number of attempts to write compilers for Ruby, using very varied approaches, so a comparative study is interesting. Some of these compilers were being lost to time and action was needed now to preserve and document them.

We're interested in how these compilers are designed and implemented, their history, and the output they produce. We're focusing on compilation in order to keep the project in some kind of scope, but we'll describe other parts of the implementation, such as the garbage collector or interpreter, where they're relevant. We apply some judgement for how much we consider to be part of the Ruby implementation. For example where components are shared between multiple language implementations, we consider them to be part of the Ruby compiler when they are co-developed.

This isn't a benchmarking game and this isn't a competition. The compilers target a variety of architectures and have diverse goals beyond simple performance so comparing quantitively would not make sense. We aim to be objective but we do offer informed commentary on the techniques employed and how successful they are in producing efficient machine code from Ruby. The [author](https://chrisseaton.com/) is the founder of the TruffleRuby compiler but is trying to neutral.

There's a page describing each compiler implementation, and an appendix describing how to build and use it. We assume medium-to-expert knowledge of compilers. If you have less experience we have a page with more simple descriptions of basic [concepts](concepts) to give you some context.

## Sources

We use a running set of [example programs](examples) throughout the survey.

The [`ruby-compiler-survey` repository](https://github.com/ruby-compiler-survey/ruby-compiler-survey/) contains this content, files that can be used to build and run the compilers, including in some cases patches, and output taken at the time of writing the survey. Compiler source code itself is archived in the [`ruby-compiler-survey` GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ruby-compiler-survey/) where possible.
